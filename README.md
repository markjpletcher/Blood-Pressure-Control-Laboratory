# Blood-Pressure-Control-Laboratory

The Blood Pressure Control Laboratory is a collaborative project led by investigators at UCSF, University of Florida, Duke, Louisiana Public Health Institute, Mayo Clinic and OCHIN.  The goal of the lab is to discover, evaluate and disseminate new ways to improve blood pressure control at scale.  A design paper describing our first round of projects, all of which use PCORnet, is here: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32142371/

BP Track is the surveillance arm of the Lab, which uses SAS queries written against the PCORnet Common Data Model to obtain standardized metrics of BP control and related processes for participating health systems across the US.  The SAS query code and code lists used in Wave 4 of BP Track is posted in the zipped folder in this repository.
